Description:
A comprehensive machine learning project for predicting audience ratings of movies using advanced regression techniques. The project includes:
Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
Feature engineering for better representation of data.
Model building and comparison using Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a Hyperparameterized Stacking Regressor.
Evaluation metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² for performance comparison.
Cross-validation for model robustness and validation.

Key Features:
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
Integration of advanced models like XGBoost and CatBoost.
Stacking Regressor with hyperparameter optimization for improved performance.
Step-by-step workflow for reproducibility.

How to Use:
Clone the repository.
Set up the required environment (requirements.txt).
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the workflow.
